Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far I am still reasearching how to manipulate audio within python, but I figured out how to import audio into python.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still have to write code that manipulates the audio imported and figure out how to export it as a new file

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

A problem I have encountered is that it is fairly difficult to manipulate audio in python. This sometimes makes it difficult to understand my sources and the code I am referring to when trying to learn about how audio files work in python.
