# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I was thinking the title of my project could be "Pythons sound effects".

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

This project would take in audio as an input and output the audio with added sound effects.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software would have built in effects that the user can apply to an audio file.  Each effect will have different parameters that the user can change.  The user would be able to choose which effect they would like to add to the sound whether it be one effect or multiple. It would be ideal if the user could save the output as a new file so that they can access it again.  

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

Let's the user import an audio file
Add at least 2 effects that the user can choose to add to the existing sound, I think this would be delay and an effect that reverses the audio.
Add Parameters that the user can change in order to vary the overall effect. For example, for the delay effect, the user can change how long the delay takes until the sound is played again.
Be able to apply these effects to the imported audio file
Have the user be able to save the audio with the efects as a new audio file



### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All the above, but add 1 or 2 more effects.  Also lets the user use multiple effects a the same time in the order they choose.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

All the above, but allows the user to use live audio that is being recorded in realtime with a microphone or through DI.
Also allows user to record the audio they're inputting through the effects.  

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

For this project my steps are to find a way to import audio, reasearch ways to code various effects, figure out how to add parameters that vary each individual effect, figure out a way to apply the effects to the imported audio, create an way for user to access and apply the effects, and find out how to save the audio after the effects have been applied.

The new skills I will have to aquire are going to be mostly learning how to work with audio files in python.  I also have to research a lot about how certain audio effects are created and whether coding them will be viable.
